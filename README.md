# GNU Makefile Tutorial:  From Zero to Writing Your Own

The purpose of this tutorial is to demystify Makefiles
and help others learn how write their own.

Requirements:
* basic knowledge of C++
* basic knowledge of C++ compilation process
* gcc compiler
* GNU make
* general Git knowledge


The tutorial takes a hands-on approach.
It consists of a few source files meant to simulate
a C++ project and a demonstration Makefile.

Start by checking out **part 1** commit and reading through the
Makefile's comment section.  Every commit adds new features
and explains new Makefile concepts.  The material is
intentionally broken down into easily-digestible portions.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,


Vlad the Maker
